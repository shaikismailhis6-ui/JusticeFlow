Task: Process the uploaded document: "${fileName}" and any embedded or attached images. Perform a comprehensive legal and forensic audit.

Capabilities to Execute:
1. Massive Context Understanding: Read the entire document. Use your 1M+ token window to ensure all pages are analyzed.
2. Automated Verification: Trigger a full audit covering:
   - Document Summary: Key facts and legal issues.
   - Evidence Forensics: Scan all embedded images or documents for AI manipulation/Deepfakes. Provide a 'Real vs Fake' verdict.
   - AI Detection: For each image, calculate the probability of it being AI-generated vs human-generated (True image).
   - Event Timeline: Extract dates and map them chronologically.
   - Legal Points: Extract critical legal arguments and applicable laws.

System Instructions:
- Maintain strict judicial neutrality.
- Provide technical reasons for evidence authenticity scores.
- Output MUST be in JSON format.

Output Constraint (Strict JSON):
